1. Performance on the development data with 100% of the training data
1a. spam precision: 0.9931
1b. spam recall: 0.9774
1c. spam F1 score: 0.9851
1d. ham precision: 0.9467
1e. ham recall: 0.9833
1f. ham F1 score: 0.9647


2. Performance on the development data with 10% of the training data
2a. spam precision: 0.9899
2b. spam recall: 0.9592
2c. spam F1 score: 0.9743
2d. ham precision: 0.9071
2e. ham recall: 0.9760
2f. ham F1 score: 0.9403


3. Description of enhancement(s) you tried (e.g., different approach(es) to smoothing, treating common words differently, dealing with unknown words differently):
    a) All the numeric features are dropped while classifying the data
    b) All the stop words and special characters have been eliminated from the dataset
    c) Laplpace (Additive-2) smoothing is used while learning
    d) Instead of ignoring all unseen data during classification, they are given a small probability
    viz. spam_probability = (1/spam_word_count) and ham_probability = (1/ham_word_count)
    and incremented as the word appears again. This improves the performance while classifying
    e) Instead of calculating probabilities based on number of email files, 
    probabilites were evaulated based on number of words (ham_words/spam_words)


4. Best performance results based on enhancements. Note that these could be the same or worse than the standard implementation.
